# Advanced CSS Project about Natour

In this project i was introduced to npm packages and scripts to compile css to sass, autoprefixer and compile everything into production code. I was heavily focused on 7-1 Sass architecture so basically my main.scss file was only importing other sass files by using @import "folder/nameOfTheFile". By sticking to 7-1 architecture my code will be future-proof and well organised which will make it easy to read and navigate through for other developers. I was also practicing on implementing animations for components using @keyframes such as the heading appearing from one side and subheading from a different one. I also used @supports feauture query because it allows me to use a variety of 'settings' for components depending on the browser support.
